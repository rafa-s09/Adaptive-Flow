|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Protocol Buffers Support**       | Add serialization/deserialization of `FlowContext` and `FlowResult` data using Protobuf.                    | - Faster and more efficient communication.<br>- Integration with modern systems (e.g., gRPC).<br>- Lower bandwidth usage. | Medium (requires Protobuf library integration and `.proto` schema definitions) | Distributed systems, high-performance APIs, real-time data exchange (e.g., online gaming).     |
| **Configurable Persistence**       | Enable `FlowContext` to use different storage backends (e.g., database, files).                             | - Flexible state management.<br>- Persistence across executions.<br>- Scalability.                | High (requires storage abstraction and multiple driver support) | Long-running workflows, systems needing state recovery.                                        |
| **Asynchronous Notifications**     | Implement an event/notification system (e.g., via Webhooks, SignalR) to report progress/failures.           | - Real-time monitoring.<br>- Integration with external tools.<br>- Quick error response.          | Medium (requires messaging or event system integration) | Critical applications, monitoring dashboards, process automation.                              |
| **Failure Point Resumption**       | Add support to resume the flow from a specific step after failures, with saved state.                      | - Reduced rework.<br>- Resilience in long flows.<br>- Improved partial failure handling.          | High (requires checkpointing and intermediate state management) | Batch data processing, ETL pipelines, high-latency tasks.                                      |
| **Dynamic Runtime Configuration**  | Allow changes to `FlowConfiguration` during execution (e.g., adding/removing steps).                       | - Real-time adaptability.<br>- Greater flexibility in dynamic scenarios.                          | High (requires runtime synchronization and validation) | Reactive systems, real-time event processing, rule-based dynamic flows.                        |
| **Protobuf for Dynamic Configuration** | Use Protocol Buffers to define and update `FlowConfiguration` dynamically at runtime.                    | - Efficient configuration updates.<br>- Compatibility with Protobuf ecosystems.<br>- Reduced payload size. | Medium-High (requires Protobuf schema for config and runtime parsing logic) | Distributed workflows, microservices with Protobuf-based communication, dynamic rule systems.  |
| **Step Priority**                  | Add a priority system for steps in `FlowConfiguration` (e.g., high, medium, low).                          | - Fine-grained execution control.<br>- Resource optimization in concurrent flows.                 | Low (modification to configuration model and execution logic) | Workflows with critical tasks, resource-constrained systems.                                   |
| **Advanced DI Integration**        | Enhance dependency injection support for steps, leveraging container configuration (e.g., .NET DI).        | - Increased modularity.<br>- Easier testing and dependency swapping.<br>- .NET standards compliance. | Medium (requires adjustments to `FromJson` and step resolution) | Complex architecture projects, extensive DI usage in .NET ecosystems.                          |
| **Advanced Conditional Support**   | Extend `Func<FlowContext, bool>` to support complex expressions or scripting (e.g., dynamic C#).            | - Richer conditional logic.<br>- Greater decision-making power in flows.<br>- Advanced customization. | High (may require a parser or scripting engine) | Workflows with complex business rules, policy-based systems.                                   |
| **Metrics and Telemetry**          | Add metrics collection (e.g., step execution time, failure rate) via OpenTelemetry or similar tools.        | - Performance visibility.<br>- Easier optimization.<br>- Production monitoring support.           | Medium (integration with existing telemetry tools) | Production applications, performance analysis, distributed systems.   |
